*try to guess whos words are these*

I have bachelore degree in Mechanical Engineering in Nazarbayev University, but after 1 year of working as an engineer I decided to try myself in programming instead. 

*Although that experience wasn't exactly a true engineer's work*

## Interesting facts

I used to have a part-time job as a tennis coach in weekends, while working on a full-time engineer position.

I have never ever been on a concert of any music artist or a band.

### Why I want to be a developer

1. Many friends think I could handle it easily, so it will be worth trying.
2. Experience and skill will be relevant in the future.
3. Working in a clean office always pleasant. *(and salary is better.)*
